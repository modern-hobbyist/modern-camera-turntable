# Modern Photography Turntable
This project is a fairly simple implementation of a photography turntable to allow me to get better videos and images of my projects!

# Files
Included in this repository are all the circuit files that I initially tried to use for milling my own PCB, but unfortunately, that didn't work. 
Instead I ended up ordering the PCB from JLCPCB and the results were spectacular!

# Installation
If you are interested in building this project, download this repo and flash the `modern-camera-turntable.ino` file to your arduino nano.
